# SHORTEST-PATH-WITH-BFS
Finding the shortest path in a 2-Dimensional grid using BFS algorithm in python using Turtle graphics.
Code is written in python and uses BFS Algorithm to find the shortest possible path between any two points in a 2D grid. Result of the path is interpreted using turtle graphics.
